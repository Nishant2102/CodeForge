# üõ†Ô∏è Codeforge

**Codeforge** is an AI-powered software agent that transforms natural language requests into complete, working projects. Built on [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), it operates like a multi-agent development team, tackling complex tasks by using real-world developer workflows to create projects file by file.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Agent System:** Employs a specialized team of AI agents for planning, architecture, and coding.
* **Developer Workflow:** Mimics a human development process, from high-level planning to file-specific implementation.
* **End-to-End Generation:** Delivers a complete, functional project from a single prompt, ready to run.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Codeforge's core power comes from its three specialized agents, each handling a critical phase of the development lifecycle:

* **Planner Agent**
    * Analyzes your request and generates a detailed, high-level project plan.

* **Architect Agent**
    * Decomposes the overall plan into a series of granular engineering tasks, providing explicit context for each file.

* **Coder Agent**
    * Executes each task by reading, writing, and modifying files, acting as the hands-on developer to build the project piece by piece.
